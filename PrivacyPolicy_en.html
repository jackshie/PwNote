    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <div class="meta">
      <div><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 2026-02-28</div>
      <div><strong>App Name:</strong> PwNote</div>
      <div><strong>Developer:</strong> Liang-Zong Shie</div>
      <div><strong>Contact:</strong> <a href="mailto:pwnote.service@gmail.com">pwnote.service@gmail.com</a></div>
    </div>

    <h2>1. Overview</h2>
    <p>
      PwNote is designed to protect your privacy. The app stores your vault data <strong>locally on your device</strong>.
      We do <strong>not</strong> operate servers to store your passwords or vault content, and we do <strong>not</strong> require you to create an account.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Data We Collect</h2>
    <p>We do <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or transmit:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your passwords, notes, or vault items</li>
      <li>Your personal identifiers (such as name, email, phone number)</li>
      <li>Your device advertising identifier (IDFA) or any device identifier used for tracking</li>
      <li>Your location, contacts, photos, or other unrelated device data</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>In short:</strong> your vault stays on your device unless you choose to export or back it up.</p>

    <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>
      Your vault is stored locally on your iPhone/iPad and is protected by your device security and your <strong>Master Password</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Master Password</strong><br />
      When you first open PwNote, you are required to create a <strong>Master Password</strong>.
      The Master Password is used <strong>only on your device</strong> to unlock the app and to encrypt/decrypt any exported encrypted backup files.
      We do not collect, store, or transmit your Master Password, and we cannot access or recover it for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Recovery Key</strong><br />
      During setup, PwNote generates a <strong>Recovery Key</strong> and shows it to you <strong>one time only</strong>.
      The Recovery Key is not sent to us and is not stored on our servers (we do not operate servers for vault storage).
      You are responsible for saving the Recovery Key in a safe place.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you forget your Master Password, you can use your Recovery Key to reset the Master Password and regain access.
      We do not collect, store, or transmit your Master Password or Recovery Key, and we cannot access or recover them for you.
    </p>
    <p class="note">
      If you lose both your Master Password and your Recovery Key, you may permanently lose access to your vault.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Biometric Unlock (Face ID)</strong><br />
      If your device supports Face ID, PwNote may offer the option to use <strong>Face ID</strong> to unlock the app as a convenience on top of your
      Master Password. You can enable or disable this option in the app settings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Face data is processed by iOS and is <strong>not accessible</strong> to PwNote. The app only receives a simple “success” or “failure” result from
      the system and does not collect, store, or transmit your biometric data.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Backups, Import, and Export</h2>
    <p>
      PwNote allows you to export and import your vault as an <strong>encrypted file</strong>. You control where that file is saved.
    </p>
    <h3>Using the iOS Files App / Cloud Storage</h3>
    <p>
      If you choose to save your encrypted backup to the iOS <strong>Files</strong> app, it may be stored in a location you select,
      such as <strong>iCloud Drive</strong> or a third-party cloud provider, depending on your device settings and installed apps.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Any cloud storage used for backups is controlled by you and governed by that provider’s own privacy policy.</li>
      <li>We do not receive a copy of your backups and do not have access to your cloud account.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Network Access</h2>
    <p>
      PwNote is primarily designed to work <strong>offline</strong>.
      Network access may be required for Apple services related to <strong>in-app purchases</strong> (e.g., purchasing Pro features)
      and <strong>restoring purchases</strong>, which are processed by Apple through the App Store, and for other user-initiated actions.
    </p>

    <h2>6. In-App Purchases</h2>
    <p>
      PwNote offers in-app purchases (e.g., unlocking Pro features), purchases are processed by <strong>Apple</strong> through the App Store.
      We do not receive your payment card details. Apple may process certain information as described in Apple’s privacy policy.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Analytics, Tracking, and Advertising</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We do <strong>not</strong> show ads.</li>
      <li>We do <strong>not</strong> use third-party advertising SDKs.</li>
      <li>We do <strong>not</strong> track you across apps or websites.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Third-Party Code</h2>
    <p>
      PwNote may include third-party open-source libraries used to provide app functionality (for example, cryptography,
      one-time password generation, or user interface components). These libraries are used locally on your device and are not used
      to collect or transmit your vault content to us.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      PwNote is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Your Choices and Control</h2>
    <p>You can control your data at any time:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Delete vault items inside the app</li>
      <li>Delete the app to remove local app data</li>
      <li>Delete any exported/backup files from Files/iCloud Drive or any cloud provider you use</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>11. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will update the “Effective Date” above.
      Continued use of the app after changes means you accept the updated policy.
    </p>
