    <h1>PwNote Support</h1>

    <div class="meta">
      <div><strong>App Name:</strong> PwNote</div>
      <div><strong>Developer:</strong> Liang-Zong Shie</div>

    <h2>1. Overview</h2>
    <p>
      PwNote is an offline password manager designed to keep your passwords and sensitive notes
      stored locally on your device. There is no account, no cloud sync, and your vault is protected
      by encryption using your Master Password.
    </p>

    <div class="note">
      <strong>Important:</strong> PwNote does not have access to your vault, Master Password, or Recovery Key.
      If you lose both your Master Password and your Recovery Key, your data cannot be recovered.
    </div>

    <h2>2. Getting Started</h2>
    <h3>2.1 First launch</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Set your <strong>Master Password</strong> when you open PwNote for the first time.</li>
      <li>PwNote will generate a <strong>Recovery Key</strong> and show it <strong>only once</strong>.</li>
      <li>Store the Recovery Key in a safe place (for example, a secure note, printed copy, or another trusted vault).</li>
      <li>After setup, you can start creating categories and items (logins, notes, etc.).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.2 Free vs Pro</h3>
    <p><strong>Free plan limits:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Up to <strong>5 categories</strong></li>
      <li>Up to <strong>30 items</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Pro (In-App Purchase) unlocks:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Unlimited items</strong> (unlimited categories and vault entries)</li>
      <li><strong>Password Generator</strong> for creating strong passwords</li>
      <li><strong>Regenerate Recovery Key</strong> (generate a new Recovery Key; the previous one becomes invalid)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Backups and Restore</h2>
    <p>
      PwNote allows you to export and import an encrypted backup file of your vault. You choose where
      to store the file using the iOS Files app (for example, iCloud Drive or another location).
    </p>

    <h3>3.1 Creating an encrypted backup</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Open PwNote and unlock your vault with your Master Password.</li>
      <li>Go to the <strong>Backup / Export</strong> section in Settings (or the menu where backup is provided).</li>
      <li>Choose <strong>Export encrypted backup</strong>.</li>
      <li>When the Files sheet appears, select a folder (e.g., iCloud Drive or “On My iPhone”) and save the file.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>3.2 Restoring from an encrypted backup</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Install PwNote on the device where you want to restore your data.</li>
      <li>Open PwNote and follow the initial setup if required.</li>
      <li>Go to the <strong>Import / Restore</strong> section in Settings.</li>
      <li>Select the encrypted backup file from the Files app.</li>
      <li>Enter your Master Password used when the backup was created (if prompted) and complete the restore.</li>
    </ol>

    <div class="note">
      <strong>Tip:</strong> Keep multiple copies of your encrypted backup (for example, iCloud Drive + local storage)
      and regularly update it after making important changes to your vault.
    </div>

    <h2>4. Pro Purchase and Restore Purchases</h2>
    <h3>4.1 Buying Pro</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Open PwNote and go to the <strong>Pro / Upgrade</strong> section (for example, in Settings).</li>
      <li>Review the Pro features and tap the <strong>Purchase</strong> button.</li>
      <li>Confirm the in-app purchase with your Apple ID.</li>
      <li>Once the purchase is successful, Pro features should be unlocked automatically.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>4.2 Restoring Pro on a new device</h3>
    <p>
      If you reinstall PwNote or switch to a new iPhone using the same Apple ID, you can restore your Pro purchase:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Open PwNote on the new or reinstalled device.</li>
      <li>Go to the <strong>Pro / Upgrade</strong> section.</li>
      <li>Tap <strong>Restore Purchases</strong>.</li>
      <li>Make sure you are signed in with the same Apple ID used for the original purchase and have an active internet connection.</li>
      <li>After restore completes, Pro features should be available again.</li>
    </ol>

    <div class="note">
      <strong>Note:</strong> If Pro does not unlock after a successful purchase or restore, try:
      <ul>
        <li>Restarting PwNote</li>
        <li>Checking that you are using the correct Apple ID</li>
        <li>Ensuring you have network connectivity</li>
      </ul>
      If the issue persists, contact support with your purchase date and any screenshots you have.
    </div>

    <h2>5. Common Questions</h2>

    <h3>5.1 I forgot my Master Password. Can you reset it for me?</h3>
    <p>
      No. For privacy and security reasons, we cannot access or reset your Master Password.
      You can only regain access by using your <strong>Recovery Key</strong>.
    </p>

    <h3>5.2 I lost both my Master Password and Recovery Key. Can you recover my data?</h3>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, no. Because we do not store your vault on any server and do not know your keys,
      your data cannot be recovered if you lose both the Master Password and the Recovery Key.
    </p>

    <h3>5.3 Does PwNote sync my data between devices?</h3>
    <p>
      PwNote does not use cloud sync or an online account. To move your vault between devices,
      please use the encrypted backup export/import via the Files app.
    </p>

    <h3>5.4 Does PwNote support SSO and OTP?</h3>
    <p>
      PwNote is designed to store and organize credentials, including logins that use SSO and accounts
      that rely on one-time passwords (TOTP) for 2FA. However, SSO and OTP are stored as entries in your vault;
      PwNote does not connect directly to external identity providers.
    </p>
